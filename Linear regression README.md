Linear Regression and Classification Models
Project Overview
This project explores linear regression and classification techniques using Python. It demonstrates how to implement these models from scratch, focusing on key concepts such as data generation, parameter estimation, and model evaluation. The notebook provides a hands-on approach to understanding the mechanics behind linear models.

What I've Learned
Data Generation: Created synthetic datasets for regression to understand the linear relationship between variables.
Model Implementation: Implemented linear regression using the Normal Equation for parameter estimation.
Data Visualization: Visualized data and model predictions to better interpret results.
Concepts of Bias and Variance: Learned about the trade-offs between bias and variance in model performance.

Key Concepts Covered
1. Setup
The notebook begins by importing essential libraries and setting up the environment.

2. Data Generation
Synthetic data is generated using a linear equation with added Gaussian noise to simulate real-world scenarios.

3. Data Visualization
Multiple visualizations are presented to illustrate the generated dataset and model performance, including scatter plots with labeled axes.

4. Linear Regression Implementation
The core of the project involves implementing the linear regression model, calculating the optimal parameters using the Normal Equation.

5. Results and Conclusions
The final section analyzes the results, demonstrating how well the model fits the data and discussing the significance of model parameters.
