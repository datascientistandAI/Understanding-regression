3. Data Visualization
Various visualizations are included to understand the generated data:

Scatter plots showing the relationship between input features and target values.
Customized labels and axes for better interpretability.
4. Linear Regression Implementation
The core section focuses on implementing linear regression:

Adding a bias term to the input features.
