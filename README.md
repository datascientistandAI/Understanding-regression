# Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, SVM, and Decision Trees

## Project Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that provide a deep understanding of three fundamental machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees. Each notebook includes theoretical insights, practical implementations, and visualizations to enhance comprehension.

## Contents

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Explores linear regression models, implementation using synthetic datasets, and the impact of parameters on model performance.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Data generation and visualization.
     - Parameter estimation using the Normal Equation.
     - Bias-variance trade-offs.

2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - Focuses on classification tasks using SVM, specifically with the Iris dataset.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - SVM fundamentals and the kernel trick.
     - Visualization of decision boundaries and support vectors.
     - Handling outliers and feature scaling.

3. **Decision Trees**
